# Sorting Algorithms Overview

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++. Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used to organize data efficiently. This project aims to implement and compare the performance of six different sorting algorithms:

1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

## Introduction

Each sorting algorithm has its own approach to ordering elements in a collection. Understanding these algorithms and their characteristics is essential for designing efficient software solutions.


## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Selection Sort

Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: one sorted and one unsorted.

### 2. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort iterates through the array multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

### 3. Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the array, removing one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the array.

### 4. Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges the sorted subarrays to produce the final sorted array.

### 5. Quick Sort

Quick Sort also uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a pivot element from the array and partitions the other elements into two subarrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the subarrays.

### 6. Heap Sort

Heap sort involves building a heap from the array, repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap, and rebuilding the heap until the array is sorted.

## Performance Comparison

In this project, we will compare the performance of these sorting algorithms by measuring their execution time and the number of basic operations (comparisons) they perform on various datasets:

- Almost sorted
- Randomly distributed
- Reverse sorted
- Datasets with many duplicates

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate C++ file. Please execute the corresponding C++ script to run the sorting algorithms and compare their performance.
